# 📈 Challenge #5 – Sales Analysis by Product Category

## 🏪 Business Context

A supermarket chain wants to understand how its sales are distributed across different product categories. The goal is to identify which categories are most profitable, which have lower participation, and whether there are opportunities to improve marketing or inventory strategies based on these insights.

## 📊 Objective

- Calculate total sales by product category.
- Compare categories to determine which are the most important in terms of revenue.
- Visualize the results using bar and pie charts.
- Share actionable conclusions and recommendations.

## 💡 Strategic Recommendations

> The best strategy depends on the supermarket’s goals. If the goal is to boost underperforming categories, promotions and incentives could help. However, if the priority is profitability, it's smarter to double down on what’s already working.

### ✅ Suggested Focus Allocation

- **70% of effort** should be directed toward **Carnes** and **Aseo**, maximizing return on investment from high-performing categories.
- **30% of effort** should support the remaining categories through:
  - Targeted promotions
  - Bundling strategies
  - Seasonal campaigns

### 📌 Additional Tactics

- Cross-selling opportunities (e.g., Carnes + Panadería).
- Loyalty programs featuring low-performing categories.
- Monthly trend monitoring to adjust strategy dynamically.
